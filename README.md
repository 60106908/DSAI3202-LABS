### **Description of the Lab**  

In this lab, we will explore the **Data Parallel Model** by implementing parallelized programs using **threads** and **processes** in Python. We will first calculate the sum of numbers sequentially and then optimize it using **multithreading** and **multiprocessing**. By measuring execution times, we will analyze the performance improvements of parallel execution. Additionally, we will compute **speedup, efficiency, and theoretical speedups** using **Amdahl’s and Gustafson’s Laws** to understand the benefits and limitations of parallelism.
